# ReiOS

A ( NOT COMPLETE ) Linux Distrobution for everyone who just started transitioning from Windows to linux and just wants an OS that just works well.

## Why ReiOS?

This distrobution is just a hobby project because i just wanted a linux distro that just works in every hardware.

## What is this distro based out of?

I've not decided to use the OG Debian. Debian just works with all kinds of hardware but the way Debian installs on the system is not beginner-friendly so thats why I choose Debian.

## Features

#### - Clean/Similar UI/UX for people who is transitioning to Linux
#### - Preinstalled office suite that is very similar to MS Office ( WPS Office for Linux? )
#### - An appstore that can easily be understood.
#### - Add a One-Click Windows Application support.
#### - Integrate NVIDIA PROPRIERTARY Driver bullcrap ( NVIDIA, F#CK YOU! -Linus Torvalds )

##  Todo List

#### [x] Finding the best base distrobution
#### [ ] LEARN how to make UI apps using flutter
#### [ ] Appstore
#### [x] Creating some concepts in mind
#### [ ] Design the os's logo
