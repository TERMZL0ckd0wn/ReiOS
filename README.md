# ReiOS
A ( NOT COMPLETE ) Linux Distrobution for beginners and experts

## Why ReiOS?
Because I was inspired for making an actual opperating system that just works on any hardware that is available today and make sure everyone understands and use the OS as a daily driver. idk maybe I'm dreaming this too much.

## What is this distro based out of?
I've not decided on this yet so maybe you should give me suggestions?

## IDC ALL ABOUT THIS BULLSH1T! JUST TELL ME THE F#CKING FEATURES!?!!
DAMN! CALM DOWN! So I've been thinking about to add:

#### - Clean/Similar UI/UX for people who is transitioning to Linux
#### - Preinstalled office suite that is very similar to MS Office ( WPS Office for Linux? )
#### - An appstore that can easily be understood ( NOOBS WITHOUT KNOWING HOW TO USE THE TERMINAL. )
#### - Add a One-Click Windows Application support ( WITH ROBLOX INSTALLER! )
#### - Integrate NVIDIA PROPRIERTARY Driver bullcrap ( NVIDIA, F#CK YOU! -Linus Torvalds )
