# ReiOS
A ( NOT COMPLETE ) Linux Distrobution for beginners and experts

## Why ReiOS?
Because I was inspired for making an actual opperating system that just works on any hardware that is available today and make sure everyone understands and use the OS as a daily driver. idk maybe I'm dreaming this too much.

## What is this distro based out of?
I've not decided on this yet so maybe you should give me suggestions?

## IDC ALL ABOUT THIS BULLSH*T! JUST TELL ME THE F*CKING FEATURES!?!!
DAMN! CALM DOWN! So I've been thinking about to add:

#### - Clean/Similar UI/UX for people who is transitioning to Linux
#### - Preinstalled office suite that is very similar to MS Office ( WPS Office for Linux? )
#### - An appstore that can easily be understood by people ( NOOBS WITHOUT KNOWING HOW TO USE THE TERMINAL. )
#### - Add a One-Click Windows Application support ( WITH ROBLOX INSTALLER! )

## NOW WHAT IS YO B*TCH A$$ DOING NOW
### - Researching how to build this in a kvm.
